## Overview

Talkomatic, a pioneering computer-based chat system, was originally developed in 1973 by Doug Brown and David R. Woolley at the University of Illinois as part of the PLATO system. In 2024, software developer [Mohd Mahmodi](https://twitter.com/mohdmahmodi) rebuilt the web version of Talkomatic, introducing modern features and improvements while preserving its innovative spirit.

This revival project was initiated with several key objectives:

1. **Historical Preservation**: To honor and maintain the legacy of one of the earliest real-time chat systems, ensuring its place in the history of online communication is not forgotten.

2. **Educational Value**: To provide a hands-on experience for those interested in the evolution of digital communication, allowing users to interact with a modernized version of a groundbreaking chat system.

3. **Technological Advancement**: To demonstrate how classic concepts can be adapted and enhanced using modern web technologies, creating a bridge between past innovations and current capabilities.

4. **Community Engagement**: To foster a community of users and developers interested in the history and future of online communication platforms.

The decision to make Talkomatic open source was driven by several factors:

1. **Collaborative Improvement**: By opening the codebase to the community, we invite diverse perspectives and skills to contribute to the project's ongoing development and refinement.

2. **Transparency**: Open source allows users to understand how the system works, building trust and encouraging a deeper appreciation of the technology.

3. **Educational Resource**: The open codebase serves as a learning tool for developers interested in real-time web applications and chat systems.

4. **Longevity**: Open source ensures that Talkomatic can continue to evolve and be maintained by the community, even beyond any single developer's involvement.

This modern iteration of Talkomatic brings the groundbreaking real-time messaging experience to contemporary users, bridging the gap between historical significance and modern communication needs. We invite you to explore, use, and contribute to this piece of computing history.
