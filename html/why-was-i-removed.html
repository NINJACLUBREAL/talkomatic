            <p>You have been temporarily removed for using offensive language on our platform. Our detection system monitors chat activities to ensure a safe and respectful environment for all users.</p>
            <p>The detection system works by scanning messages for words and phrases that are highly associated with offensive or inappropriate content. Only serious offensive language is removed; not all foul language is on the ban list. Our ban list will continue to grow and change based on community feedback and evolving standards.</p>
            <p>This ban is not permanent. You will be able to access the site again once the countdown ends, and you can continue to use the site just as before.</p>
            <p>We encourage you to review our community guidelines and ensure that your interactions are respectful and appropriate in the future.</p>
