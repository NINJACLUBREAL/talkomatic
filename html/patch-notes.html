                    <h3>Direct Redirection to Removed Page</h3>
                    <p>We've fixed an issue where users getting removed would briefly see the homepage before being redirected to removed.html. Now, the redirection happens directly without flashing the homepage.</p>
                </li>

            <p>Welcome to v2.0.2.0 of Talkomatic! We're excited to bring you several important bug fixes and new features to enhance your chatting experience. Here's what's new in this update:</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
            <h3>Duplicate User Prevention</h3>
            <p>We've resolved an issue where the same user could appear multiple times in a single room on the same device. This fix ensures a more accurate representation of active users in each room and prevents confusion.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users can no longer join a room they're already present in from the same device.</li>
                <li>Attempts to rejoin the same room will result in a notification informing the user they're already in the room and will send them back to the lobby. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>New Features</h2>
            <h3>Inactivity Management</h3>
            <p>To maintain active and engaging conversations, we've implemented an inactivity timer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users who remain inactive (don't type) for 2 minutes will be automatically removed from the room.</li>
                <li>This feature helps keep rooms dynamic and frees up space for active participants.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Join Notification Sound</h3>
            <p>Enhance your awareness of new participants with our new audio feature:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A subtle sound now plays when a new user joins a room.</li>
                <li>This audio cue helps you stay informed about new chat participants without the need to constantly monitor the user list.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Multi-Room Participation</h3>
            <p>We've expanded Talkomatic's capabilities to allow for more flexible participation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users can now join multiple rooms simultaneously by opening Talkomatic in different tabs.</li>
                <li>This feature allows you to engage in various conversations or monitor multiple rooms at once.</li>
                <li>Each tab operates independently, maintaining separate room sessions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

            <h2>Updated User Removal Policy</h2>
            <p>Instead of a 30-minute ban for typing hateful messages, users are now redirected to a "Removed from Chat" page that explains why they were removed and emphasizes that such behavior is unacceptable. Users can rejoin Talkomatic after 30 seconds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Improved 'Removed' and 'Why Was I Removed?' Pages</h2>
